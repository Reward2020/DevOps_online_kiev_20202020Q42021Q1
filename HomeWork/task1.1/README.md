## Describe of DevOps

_The concept of DevOps originated in 2009 and was intended to solve the problems 
of interaction between teams of development and operation of software products by clients.
DevOps is a teamwork between developers and testing, rather it is a suite or 
“DevOps tool chain” of multiple tools that captures the key aspects of software development and delivery._
