## Describe of DevOps

The concept of DevOps originated in 2009 and was intended to solve the problems 
of interaction between teams of development and operation of software products by clients.
DevOps is a teamwork between developers and testing, rather it is a suite or 
“DevOps tool chain” of multiple tools that captures the key aspects of software development and delivery.
